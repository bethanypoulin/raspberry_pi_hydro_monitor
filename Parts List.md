-   [Magnifying glass](https://www.amazon.com/Carson-MagniView-Lightweight-Hand-Held-Inspection/dp/B000PCYGXA/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1532762091&sr=1-1&keywords=magnifying+glass) or Lupe (things are small and most of us are over 14 so 4 pt type is difficult to read)

-   [Cheap Multimeter](https://www.amazon.com/Innova-3300-Hands-free-Digital-Multimeter/dp/B001O1X65A/ref=sr_1_7?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1532762025&sr=1-7&keywords=multimeter) - (free from Harbor frieght with a coupon)

Computing Components
--------------------

-   [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3055) - if you are simply copying code, the A+ is fine, if you will be developing on the Pi you wil either need a B+ or Pi3 or a powered USB hub to facilitate connecting with mouse, keyboard, WIFI dongle etc

-   [HDMI Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Female-Converter-Adapter-Projectors-devices/dp/B072SNVKDF/ref=asc_df_B072SNVKDF/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=241890262974&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10128193851973741936&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9014970&hvtargid=pla-445334471462&psc=1) to attach to your monitor VGA momitor or an [HDMI Cable & monitor](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-1-Pack/dp/B014I8SSD0) (I use a 12 year old Apple cinima screen with a DVI to HDMI adapterbut you could easily use an HDMI a flatscreen television while programming the Pi

-   [2.5 Amp power supply](MFH-D%205V/2.5A%20Power%20Supply%20Micro%20USB%20Charger%20Adapter%20with%20On%20Off%20Switch%20for%20Raspberry%20Pi%203/2%20Model%20B) ( you can get away with 1.5 amps on older models, but the Pi3 needs the full monty 2.5 amps)

-   Simple Keyboard
-   Wireless Mouse (you can use a wired mouse, but it gets tangled in everything and drages your Raspberry Pi all over the desktop)
